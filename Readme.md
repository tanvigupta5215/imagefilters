#IMAGE FILTERS
I developed these filters as a part of assignments given by stanford course.The purpose of the assignment was to learn how to work with images in python. 

##Reflection.py
Generate a new image with twice the height. The top half
of the image is the same as the original. The bottom half is the mirror
reflection of the top half.

##Forestfire.py
This program highlights fires in an image by identifying
pixels who red intensity is more than INTENSITY_THRESHOLD times
the average of the red, green, and blue values at a pixel.
Those "sufficiently red" pixels are then highlighted in the
image and the rest of the image is turned grey, by setting the
pixels red, green, and blue values all to be the same average
value.

##Warhol filter
This takes an image and creates a warhol effect

##Codeinplace filter
This filter implements a red image filter
